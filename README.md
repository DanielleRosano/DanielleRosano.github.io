Hi, my name is Danielle Rosano and I am from Northern New Jersey. I am a freshman studying Psychology here at Lehigh University in the College of Arts and Sciences. I decided to take Intro to Data Journalism as my seminar this year and I am super excited about it. I find using data to tell a story to be interesting and efficient and I am excited to learn more about it! I have no experience with coding but I hope to learn more using GitHub.
