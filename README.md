# Welcome to my GitHub page!ðŸ˜Š
Hi, my name is Danielle Rosano and I am from Northern New Jersey. I am a freshman studying Psychology here at [Lehigh University](https://www1.lehigh.edu/) in the College of Arts and Sciences. I decided to take Intro to Data Journalism as my seminar this year and I am super excited about it. I find using data to tell a story to be interesting and efficient and I am excited to learn more about it! I have no experience with coding but I hope to learn more using GitHub.

# Covid-19 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Infographic:

This infographic below displays the coronavirus cases and deaths within Pennsylvania, Lehigh county, and Northampton county. Bethlehem, PA lies in both the Lehigh and Northampton counties. This model compares the number of cases and deaths in each subsection of Pennsylvania. Clearly, there are more cases and fatalities in Lehigh County than Northampton county. This data came from the city of Bethlehem's official website, which has a section dedicated to Coronavirus and the data that comes along with it. The direct link to the data is [here](https://bethlehem-pa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/05299d6e930643ef8d507ac2f61cf9d6, but the city's website with other coronavirus information is https://www.bethlehem-pa.gov/Health-Bureau/Communicable-Diseases/COVID-19). I found this data to be interesting because I think it's important to see how location might play a role in coronavirus cases and death totals. I did not know much about the numbers around Lehigh until I did this research and it was very eye-opening. It feels like we are in a bubble here at Lehigh since there are no cases on campus and we have not suffered drastically from the virus yet (knock on wood). Seeing these numbers and realizing just how serious this virus is in this area is important and informative. This data can also lead to more research on how the counties have handled the virus in different ways and what is more effective in keeping numbers low. Overall, the data on Covid-19 cases in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania as well as surrounding areas is significantly informative and can lead to much more research on how this virus works.

# Ariana Grande Career Timeline
Ariana Grande is one of my favorite artists and I have always loved her work in both the acting world and music industry. She is 27 years old and is one of the most famous singers of our generation. She has been acting and singing since she was a child and has had great success throughout her career. She has been on various TV shows and has released a total of 5 studio albums, as well as being featured on several others. She has been very successful in her career and has been recognized in various ways, so it was hard to narrow down the main events in her career for this timeline. I managed to narrow it down to 10 main events however there are obviously many other significant events that have happened throughout her career that are not included in the timeline below.

# Spotify's Top Songs 2019
The bar chart below shows the top 5 most streamed songs on Spotify in 2019. To demonstrate the number of streams, the numbers are divided by 1 million to easily understand the amount for each song and to easily compare them. The information is from an article by [Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/annabenyehudarahmanan/2019/12/04/spotify-releases-data-on-most-streamed-music-and-artists-of-the-decade/#238e4d07d213), which lists the most streamed artists, albums, and songs in 2019 on Spotify. I collected the data about the most streamed songs and put them into a spreadsheet that I then created into a bar chart as seen below.

# Lehigh Students' Preferred Party Locations - Interactive Data Visualization
Below are two interactive data visualizations that were created using Tableau. This information is based on the responses to a Lehigh Party Scene Survey that was created in 2016. These visualizations help us understand how gender and status at Lehigh influence preferred party locations. From the visualizations, we know that sophomores at Lehigh prefer parties that are off campus. We also know that females prefer off campus parties while males prefer parties in fraternity houses. There are many things that can be inferred from the data about how gender and age affects party location preference as well as other variables.

# Ivy League Statistics 2019
## Interactive Data Visualization
In the interactive data visualization below, there are two graphics with information about Ivy League admissions in 2019 from [Ivy Coach](https://www.ivycoach.com/2019-ivy-league-admissions-statistics/), an online college counseling company. The first graphic is a map labeled with the eight Ive League schools in the US. Using the legend and filters that go with the graphic, it is possible to understand how the acceptance rates, number of applications received, and number of acceptances differ from school to school; this gives a sense of how selective each university is. The second graphic is a bar chart that shows how many Early Decision/Action vs. Regular Decision applications were accepted by each Ivy League. This gives the viewer an understanding of just how much each school values early applications versus regular ones. There is also a legend and filters that go with this graphic. These allow the viewer to choose from several other statistics and decide what is presented in the bar chart. From this data visualization, we can better understand valuable information regarding admission at Ivy League schools.
