Hi, my name is Danielle Rosano and I am from Northern New Jersey. I am a freshman studying Psychology here at [Lehigh University](https://www1.lehigh.edu/) in the College of Arts and Sciences. I decided to take Intro to Data Journalism as my seminar this year and I am super excited about it. I find using data to tell a story to be interesting and efficient and I am excited to learn more about it! I have no experience with coding but I hope to learn more using GitHub.

# Covid-19 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Infographic:

This infographic below displays the coronavirus cases and deaths within Pennsylvania, Lehigh county, and Northampton county. Bethlehem, PA lies in both the Lehigh and Northampton counties. This model compares the number of cases and deaths in each subsection of Pennsylvania. Clearly, there are more cases and fatalities in Lehigh County than Northampton county. This data came from the city of Bethlehem's official website, which has a section dedicated to Coronavirus and the data that comes along with it. The direct link to the data is [here](https://bethlehem-pa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/05299d6e930643ef8d507ac2f61cf9d6, but the city's website with other coronavirus information is https://www.bethlehem-pa.gov/Health-Bureau/Communicable-Diseases/COVID-19). I found this data to be interesting because I think it's important to see how location might play a role in coronavirus cases and death totals. I did not know much about the numbers around Lehigh until I did this research and it was very eye-opening. It feels like we are in a bubble here at Lehigh since there are no cases on campus and we have not suffered drastically from the virus yet (knock on wood). Seeing these numbers and realizing just how serious this virus is in this area is important and informative. This data can also lead to more research on how the counties have handled the virus in different ways and what is more effective in keeping numbers low. Overall, the data on Covid-19 cases in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania as well as surrounding areas is significantly informative and can lead to much more research on how this virus works.

# Ariana Grande Career Timeline
Ariana Grande is one of my favorite artists and I have always loved her work in both the acting world and music industry. She is 27 years old and is one of the most famous singers of our generation. She has been acting and singing since she was a child and has had great success throughout her career. She has been on various TV shows and has released a total of 5 studio albums, as well as being featured on several others. She has been very successful in her career and has been recognized in various ways, so it was hard to narrow down the main events in her career for this timeline. I managed to narrow it down to 10 main events however there are obviously many other significant events that have happened throughout her career that are not included in the timeline below.

# Spotify's Top Songs 2019
The bar chart below shows the top 5 most streamed songs on Spotify in 2019. To demonstrate the number of streams, the numbers are divided by 1 million to easily understand the amount for each song and to easily compare them. The information is from an article by Forbes, which lists the most streamed artists, albums, and songs in 2019 on Spotify. I collected the data about the most streamed songs and put them into a spreadsheet that I then created into a bar chart as seen below.
