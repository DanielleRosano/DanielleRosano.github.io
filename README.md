Hi, my name is Danielle Rosano and I am from Northern New Jersey. I am a freshman studying Psychology here at Lehigh University in the College of Arts and Sciences. I decided to take Intro to Data Journalism as my seminar this year and I am super excited about it. I find using data to tell a story to be interesting and efficient and I am excited to learn more about it! I have no experience with coding but I hope to learn more using GitHub.

Below is an infographic showing the percentages of undergraduate enrollment in each of the colleges at Lehigh University in 2019.

# Covid-19 in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania Infographic:

This infographic below displays the coronavirus cases and deaths within Pennsylvania, Lehigh county, and Northampton county. Bethlehem, PA lies in both the Lehigh and Northampton counties. This model compares the number of cases and deaths in each subsection of Pennsylvania. Clearly, there are more cases and fatalities in Lehigh County than Northampton county. This data came from the city of Bethlehem's official website, which has a section dedicated to Coronavirus and the data that comes along with it. The direct link to the data is https://bethlehem-pa.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/05299d6e930643ef8d507ac2f61cf9d6, but the city's website with other coronavirus information is https://www.bethlehem-pa.gov/Health-Bureau/Communicable-Diseases/COVID-19. I found this data to be interesting because I think it's important to see how location might play a role in coronavirus cases and death totals. I did not know much about the numbers around Lehigh until I did this research and it was very eye-opening. It feels like we are in a bubble here at Lehigh since there are no cases on campus and we have not suffered drastically from the virus yet (knock on wood). Seeing these numbers and realizing just how serious this virus is in this area is important and informative. This data can also lead to more research on how the counties have handled the virus in different ways and what is more effective in keeping numbers low. Overall, the data on Covid-19 cases in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania as well as surrounding areas is significantly informative and can lead to much more research on how this virus works.
