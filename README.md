Hi, my name is Danielle Rosano and I am from Northern New Jersey. I am a freshman studying Psychology here at Lehigh University. I decided to take Intro to Data Journalism as my seminar this year and I am super excited about it. I have no experience with coding but I hope to learn more about it through GitHub.
